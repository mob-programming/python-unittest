## The challenge

The coding challenge for this workshop was to solve FizzBuzz, as a mob, using test driven development.
The team followed a strict [_driver-navigator_](https://mobprogramming.org/mob-programming-basics/) pattern of mobbing with the timer set to 4 minutes.

For each positive integer _i_ in (1, n):
- Print Fizz! if number is divisible by 3
- Print Buzz! if number is divisible by 5
- Print FizzBuzz if number is divisible by 3 & 5
- Otherwise just print _i_.
