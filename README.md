## July Mob Programming Challenge

### Implement a singly linked-list.

See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_list

As a programmer, I should be able to use the LinkedList class to:
   - append a node to the end of the list
   - push a node to the front of the list
   - print the list, in order
   - remove nodes by data value
   - pop nodes off the end of the list and receive the value of the popped node
   - get a reversed list
   - get a list from an existing linked list with duplicates removed (a linked set)

### Stretch goals

   - return a sorted version of the list as an array
   - ensure that the list is self-sorting by alphanumeric order (by ASCII value)

 Guidelines
 ----------
   - use TDD to implement the solution
   - think more about what makes good mobbing than racing to complete the solution
