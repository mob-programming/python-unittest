# python-unittest - November Mob Programming Workshop

This code was created during the November mob programming workshop.

## The challenge

In Conway's Game of Life, each cell on a grid responds to the number neighbors it has.

Implement a game board, and cells that know how many neighbors they have.

- assume the game board is infinite
- every game board starts with a configuration. That is, at the start you can give it a list of cell positions that are occupied.
every cell always knows how many neighbors it has
- use any programming language you wish that is installed on the system

## Requirements

Python >= 3.6

It is recommended to use a virtualenv for any projects.

## Setup

1. Clone this repo
2. Create a branch
3. Do your work on the branch
